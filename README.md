A person can fall in love quickly. As British scientists confirm, it will take 8.2 seconds for a person to fall in love with someone. 
The scientists explain that a look of 4 seconds is a right proof that a man is impressed and interested.
But there is an interesting thing that this rule doesn’t work for women. 
This look means nothing for them. They can look at a man even much longer without falling in love.
British scientists decided to study it and invite more than one hundred students for an experiment.
Then they hid cameras to observe the movements of the students’ eyes. Then students were asked to complete a form.
In the end they get a result that 8.2 seconds is even more than enough to fall in love. To tell the truth this experiment doesn’t seem serious. 
Indeed to make reliable statistic results it’s necessary to have several thousand cases which should be studied and analyzed.
It seems that this question stays in God’s jurisdiction as before. And it cannot be predicted in advance.
